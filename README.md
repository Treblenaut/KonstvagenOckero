# Konstvågen Öckerö - Android App Privacy Policy

This privacy policy regards the software application Konstvågen Öckerö, created by Sebastian Persson, on commission of Kulturföreningen Konstvågen. The Application is a digital version of an art installation brochure. You may see the information about the event Konstvågen Öckerö, and browse through all the artists featured during this event.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. The map functionality is only meant to show static data and does NOT use geolocation. IF this feature is implemented in the future, the app will never collect any location data from you without your explicit consent.

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy here. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes. You can check the history of this policy by clicking here.

If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, or have questions about our practices, please contact us via email at sebastian@baslundvisuals.com.
